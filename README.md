# DIP-PROJECT
 There are three programs or ‘.m’ files for this project.
 <br />
-**Template Creation** (template_creation.m)– This is used to call the saved images of alphanumerics and then save them as a new template in MATLAB memory.
 <br />
-**Letter Detection**(Letter_detection.m) – Reads the characters from the input image and find the highest matched corresponding alphanumeric.
 <br />
-**Plate Detection**(Plate_detection.m) – Process the image and then call the above two m-files to detect the number.
