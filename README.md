# DIP-PROJECT
 There are three programs or ‘.m’ files for this project.
 <br />
-**Template Creation** (template_creation.m)– This is used to call the saved images of alphanumerics and then save them as a new template in MATLAB memory.
 <br />
-**Letter Detection**(Letter_detection.m) – Reads the characters from the input image and find the highest matched corresponding alphanumeric.
 <br />
-**Plate Detection**(Plate_detection.m) – Process the image and then call the above two m-files to detect the number.
 <br />
**Template Creation**
 <br />
First create a folder for the project (my folder name is Number Plate Detection) to save and store the files. We have stored the binary images of all the alphabets and numbers in the sub-folder named as ‘alpha'.
